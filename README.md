# Did You Do the Reading?

Did You Do the Reading was created to save time for teachers. It makes use of 6 different natural language API's, including IBM Watson and Google's Natural Language API, to generate quiz questions based on a selected text. Teachers can use this application to create interactive quiz games about assigned reading in literature, history, or current events. Students can join the game from their own devices while the flow of the game is controlled from the teacher's computer.
